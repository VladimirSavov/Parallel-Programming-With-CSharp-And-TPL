## Area 51:
The purpose of the program is to simulate an elevator system in a secure facility where agents with different security levels move randomly between floors. The program uses separate threads to model agents' movements and the elevator's operations. Agents interact with the elevator by calling it, entering, and selecting floors via an API. The elevator performs security checks before opening its doors based on the minimum security level of agents inside. The simulation includes random agent movements, wait times, and elevator operations, providing a basic representation of real-world scenarios in a multithreaded environment.
